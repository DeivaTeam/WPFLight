WPFLight
========

Version 0.1

WPFLight is a port of the Windows Presentation Foundation based on Microsoft XNA/MonoGame that allows you to build rich cross-gui applications for Windows Phone, Windows Store, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. It's in an early preview state and I use it in my own apps on these platforms. My goal is to use the original namespaces and classes of the WPF.
